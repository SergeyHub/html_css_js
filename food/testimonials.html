                <p>My friend and I were at the French Gourmet last night for dinner.
                    I want to thank you and the rest of the staff for the excellent food and
                    service provided.
                    It was our first visit and we both agreed that it was a wonderful
                    experience.</p>

                <p>First, I wanted to thank you once again for accommodating the gift
                    certificate on New Year’s Eve. The meal was outstanding, my guests
                    thought they we’re in a fancy restaurant and couldn’t believe how
                    tender the filet was.

        Close
        Iceland has recorded more than 50,000 earthquakes in the past three weeks.
        This unusual activity indicates a volcanic eruption is on its way.
        Scientists are baffled over when it will happen and Icelanders are learning

    <h3>Space projects scrubbed in UK overseas aid cut</h3>
    <p>Ten initiatives that would have used space data to tackle developing-world problems,

        But for the affected projects, it has left them scrambling to find alternative financing
        in an attempt to keep their ideas alive.</p>
